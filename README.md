# Discnerd

## Dev

### Test

```
poetry run pytest
``` 



## QA

### Why use yaml to store the disc data?
The data you create with discnerd should be portable, and independent of discnerd.
yaml is easy to read and edit without any tools.


### Why not manage discs with the udisc app?
Discnerd manages your disc golf data, and because your data is stored on your device in a reasonable format,
you can do whatever you want with your data.
